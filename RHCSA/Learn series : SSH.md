## Introduction

In this article, we discuss on high level what SSH is. Objective is not to know the nitty-gritty details, but enough to sufficiently provide overwiew of SSH.<br>
SSH is not tested in details for both RHCSA and LFCS exams, but it is essential tools for lots of troubleshooting scenarios. An engineer have to at the very least, know how to operate SSH, and figure out what could be the issue if SSH is somehow not working. <br>

> Note: We use Red Hat as example for this article.

## Outro

As we are using local repositories, Red Hat will keep displaying the message to encourage registering the VM to entitlement server. 
This is expected and can safely be ignored. 

Note that the limitation of using local repositories is that it's limited to packages available in the ISO image file. If it does not contain packages that we want, we still need to use online repositories for that.
