### Introduction

In Linux, **autofs** is a service that automatically mounts and unmounts filesystems (like network shares, USB drives, or NFS exports) on demand.

Instead of keeping a filesystem mounted all the time, autofs mounts it only when a user or process tries to access it, and automatically unmounts it after a period of inactivity. 

ðŸ”‘ Key points about autofs:

+ It is controlled by the automount daemon.
+ Uses configuration files like _/etc/auto.master_ and _/etc/auto.*_ to define mount points and rules.
+ Saves system resources by not keeping unused mounts active.
+ Commonly used for NFS mounts in enterprise environments (e.g., home directories on a central server).

**autofs** comes with many advantages. These come in handy when environment becomes more hectic, and manual task keeping getting tedious.

  <summary> Advantages</summary><br>
  
âœ… No manual entries required in /etc/fstab â€“ avoiding error-prone editing, simplifies configuration and reduces static mount dependencies.

âœ… Wildcard mounting for multi-user environments â€“ automatically mounts each userâ€™s home directory from an NFS server, enabling centralized control and easy distribution of shared resources.

âœ… On-demand mounting â€“ filesystems are mounted only when accessed, avoiding unnecessary mounts.

âœ… Automatic unmounting â€“ inactive filesystems are unmounted after a timeout, freeing resources and preventing stale mounts (especially useful with NFS).

âœ… Reduced boot delays â€“ system startup isnâ€™t slowed down or blocked by unavailable servers or devices.

âœ… Flexible support â€“ works with local disks, NFS, CIFS/SMB, removable media, and even programmatic/script-based mounts.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
If _/home/users_ is managed by autofs, the directory _/home/users/alice_ wonâ€™t be mounted until someone accesses it, and it will unmount automatically later if idle.
