### Introduction

In Linux, **autofs** is a service that automatically mounts and unmounts filesystems (like network shares, USB drives, or NFS exports) on demand.

Instead of keeping a filesystem mounted all the time, autofs mounts it only when a user or process tries to access it, and automatically unmounts it after a period of inactivity. 

ðŸ”‘ Key points about autofs:

+ It is controlled by the automount daemon.
+ Uses configuration files like _/etc/auto.master_ and _/etc/auto.*_ to define mount points and rules.
+ Saves system resources by not keeping unused mounts active.
+ Commonly used for NFS mounts in enterprise environments (e.g., home directories on a central server).

**autofs** comes with many advantages. These come in handy when environment becomes more hectic, and manual task keeping getting tedious.

  <summary> Advantages</summary><br>
  
âœ… No manual entries required in /etc/fstab â€“ avoiding error-prone editing, simplifies configuration and reduces static mount dependencies.

âœ… Wildcard mounting for multi-user environments â€“ automatically mounts each userâ€™s home directory from an NFS server, enabling centralized control and easy distribution of shared resources.

âœ… On-demand mounting â€“ filesystems are mounted only when accessed, avoiding unnecessary mounts.

âœ… Automatic unmounting â€“ inactive filesystems are unmounted after a timeout, freeing resources and preventing stale mounts (especially useful with NFS).

âœ… Reduced boot delays â€“ system startup isnâ€™t slowed down or blocked by unavailable servers or devices.

âœ… Flexible support â€“ works with local disks, NFS, CIFS/SMB, removable media, and even programmatic/script-based mounts.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
If _/home/users_ is managed by autofs, the directory _/home/users/alice_ wonâ€™t be mounted until someone accesses it, and it will unmount automatically later if idle.

### Concept

When a user tries to access a local directory (aka mountpoint) in NFS client, **autofs** service will automatically mount the corresponding directory that is mapped on the NFS server for the user. 
**autofs** utilizes few Systemd services for this: mountd, nfs-server and rpcbind. Therefore, these services and their ports need to be running and opened respectively on the NFS server.

This mapping between local mountpoints and remote directories determined how those directories are accessed. Mounting options can be specified similarly as in _/etc/fstab_.
