This is my personal Linux repo about my Linux learning journey. 
I use this repository to document all what I have learned about Linux in my career and personal life. 
It has no particular structure, but I am trying my best to make it organizable. 

I used many tools in learning Linux, mostly VMware Fusion and Workstation. 
My favourite Linux distro is Red Hat. I love its "cleaner" interface compares to Ubuntu. 

Since there is overwhelming information, I categorized them by:

  🐯 VMware - Articles related to VMware products, like Fusion and Workstation. Contains some tips and walkthrough using the product.<br>
  🐽 RHCSA - Articles related to Red Hat Certififed System Administrator. Contains tasks that are tested in the exam.<br>
  🍓 Container - Articles related to containerization and virtualization. Contains tips and learning stuffs.<br>

I treat this as my personal blog, so it can benefits myself and wider audiences who happened to stumble upon it. 

Many thanks. 

💔💖💘💗
